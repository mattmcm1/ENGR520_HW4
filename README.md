This repo contains my code for homework 4 in ENGR 520.

Specifically, it contains the following:
- Jupyter notebook to train an agent in the gymnasium Frozen Lake environment using Q-learning
- Jupyter notebook to train an agent in the gymnasium Frozen Lake environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- gifs of the paths determined by each agent, for various parameter spaces

For information on training an agent in a gymnasium environment, visit https://gymnasium.farama.org/
For information on the Frozen Lake environment specifically, visit https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/
