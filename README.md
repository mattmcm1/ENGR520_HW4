This repo contains my code for homework 4 in ENGR 520.

Specifically, it contains the following:
- Jupyter notebook to train an agent in the gymnasium Frozen Lake environment using Q-learning
- Jupyter notebook to train an agent in the gymnasium Frozen Lake environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

If you run the notebooks all the way through, you will see an animation of the path that was decided in the final training episode! Note that it sometimes breaks the animation to run both the non-slip and slip models in the same kernel. I would recommend restarting the kernel before moving to a different Frozen Lake environment.
